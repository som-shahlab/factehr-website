# 🧠 FactEHR: A Benchmark for Fact Decomposition of Clinical Notes

**FactEHR** is a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform **factual reasoning** over clinical notes. It includes:

- **2,168** deidentified notes from multiple publicly available datasets  
- **8,665** LLM-generated fact decompositions  
- **987,266** entailment pairs evaluating precision and recall of facts  
- **1,036** expert-annotated examples for evaluation

FactEHR supports LLM evaluation across tasks like **information extraction**, **entailment classification**, and **model-as-a-judge** reasoning.

> [!WARNING]  
> **Usage Restrictions:** The FactEHR dataset is subject to a Stanford Dataset DUA. Sharing data with LLM API providers is prohibited.  
> We follow PhysioNet’s responsible use principles for running LLMs on sensitive clinical data:
> 
> - ✅ Use **Azure OpenAI** (with human review opt-out)  
> - ✅ Use **Amazon Bedrock** (private copies of foundation models)  
> - ✅ Use **Google Gemini via Vertex AI** (non-training usage)  
> - ✅ Use **Anthropic Claude** (no prompt data used for training)
> - ❌ **Do not transmit data** to commercial APIs (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) unless HIPAA-compliant and explicitly permitted  
> - ❌ **Do not share** notes or derived outputs with third parties

## 🧪 Running the Experiments

We support two core experiments for evaluating factual reasoning in clinical notes:

### 1. 🧩 Fact Decomposition

This task involves prompting LLMs to extract structured atomic facts from raw clinical notes.

**Inputs:**
- Notes from `combined_notes_110424.csv`
- Prompt templates in `prompts/`
- An LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Bedrock)

**Outputs:**
- A list of decomposed facts per note (stored in `fact_decompositions_*.csv`)

See [docs/experiments.md](docs/experiments.md#1-generating-fact-decompositions) for instructions on:
- Supported prompt formats
- Batch processing with rate-limited APIs
- Handling invalid or unparseable outputs

---

### 2. 🔍 Entailment Evaluation

FactEHR supports two entailment settings:
- **Precision (`note ⇒ fact`)** — Does a note imply a given fact?
- **Recall (`fact ⇒ sentence`)** — Does a fact imply a sentence in the note?

**Approaches:**
- Use your own classifier or fine-tuned entailment model
- Use an LLM-as-a-judge (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to score entailment pairs

**Inputs:**
- Entailment pairs in `entailment_pairs_110424.csv`
- Fact decompositions and source notes
- Optional: human-labeled samples for evaluation

**Outputs:**
- Entailment predictions (binary labels or probabilities)
- Comparison against human annotations for calibration

See [docs/experiments.md](docs/experiments.md#2-running-llm-experiments) for:
- Prompting logic
- Suggested evaluation metrics
- Example LLM judge scripts
